  This is a personal blog. Let's try to make it =)

  Back in time almost 20 years ago I was supporting my school's website. I wrote everything in the Notbook locally at home and put all txt files with me on 3.5 inches diskette. At computer class at school I gave it to my teacher of informatics and he somehow deploy it to the full-tower physical server.
